-- Ensemble methods is a machine learning technique that combines several base models in order to produce one optimal predictive model. 

-- We have used ensembling of two outputs obtained from two models catboostRegessor and LightGBM.

-- For this competition we used two models and the final output was generated taking the average of the two models. 

-- Final Output  = (Output from the CatBoost_model + Output from the LightGBM_model)/2.
